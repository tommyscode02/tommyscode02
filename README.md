- 👋 Hi, my name is Maciek and you can find here some of my projects that I am currently working on. Despite the fact that I am big fan of industry automation and PLC programming, I also have interest programming smaller devices like microcontrollers. Currently I am trying to figure something out about STM32 which is very common control device.
